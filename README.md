Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles towards the design , development,testing and maintenance of software systems.
importance:software engineering focuses to create software that the user needs,is maintainable and can adapt to changes over time.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Birth of software engineering-happened in 1968 where it marked the recognition of software development as an engineering displine.
2.Rise of structured programming-happened between 1970-1980's.During this period there was the introduction of languages like c,pascal and Ada which helped developers write more
    modular,readable and maintable code.This milestone improved software realibility and maintainability.
3.Advent of Agile method-happened in 2001.Was introduced as a responce to the limitations of the waterfall development method.Agile emphasized on flexibilty,iterative development and 
    customer collaboration.Agile mae software engineering faster andd more adaptive.
    

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-define project goals,scope,recources and budget.
2.Requirement analysis-gather user needs and system requirement.
3.Design-create the system architecture,database structures and UI/UX
4.Development-actual coding is carried out.depends on the design phase.
5.Testing-involves looking for bugs,vulnerabilities and issues regarding the overall system performance.
6.Deployment-releasing the software to users in a production environment.
7.Maintenance-fixing bugs,updating features.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.Flexibility-in waterfall method changes are difficult to implement while in Agile method is highly flexible hence adapts to changing requirement.
2.Customer involvement-in waterfall method customer involvement is minimal after the initial requirement phase while in Agile method there is continuos involvement through feedback in   
    each sprint
3.Approach-waterfall method uses a linear and sequantial aproach while agile uses a iterative and incremental approach.
4.Testing-in waterfall methodology ot happens after development is complete while in Agile method testing happens continuosly through development.

Waterfall methodology examples of scenarios: 1.Government projects,involves strict requirements and fixed budgets which makes this methodology necessary
                                               2.enterprise software with fixed requirement.
Agile methodolgy examples of sscenarios:Mobile app development,features can be added progressively based on user testing.AI and nachine learning projects,requires experimentation and 
                                        incremental improvements based on evolving datasets.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
